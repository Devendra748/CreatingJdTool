# PDF Checking Tool / JD Matching Tool

## Introduction

The PDF Checking Tool, also known as the JD Matching Tool, is a system designed to query and analyze a folder of PDF/Doc resumes without the need for pre-structuring the data. The tool aims to automate the process of skill matching between the job description and the candidates' resumes.

## Requirements

- 200+ resumes available in a folder (can be a local folder, Google Drive, or S3).
- A text job description of approximately 200-300 words.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Skill Matrix Creation

The PDF Checking Tool will create a skill matrix for each job description, presenting the skills mentioned in the job description in the form of a table. The matrix will also include a total score or rating that represents how well the candidates' skills match the job requirements.

### Task 2: Query and Resume Retrieval

The tool will allow users to enter any query related to the job description and fetch relevant answers along with the candidate's name and a link to their resume file. This functionality will enable quick and efficient screening of candidates based on the skills mentioned in the job description.

## How the Tool Works

The PDF Checking Tool utilizes various libraries and components for its functionality. Below is an overview of some of the key components used:

### Components:

- **langchain.document_loaders.UnstructuredPDFLoader:** This component allows loading unstructured data from PDF resumes.

- **langchain.indexes.VectorstoreIndexCreator:** This component helps in creating vector indexes for efficient retrieval of information.

- **langchain.chains.RetrievalQA:** The RetrievalQA chain is used to perform question-answering tasks based on the provided job description and candidate resumes.

- **langchain.llms.OpenAI:** The OpenAI language model is used for various language processing tasks.

- **langchain.text_splitter.CharacterTextSplitter:** This component splits the text into smaller chunks for better processing.

- **langchain.embeddings.OpenAIEmbeddings:** OpenAI Embeddings are used to represent the textual data in a numerical format.

- **langchain.vectorstores.Chroma:** The Chroma vector store helps in efficiently storing and retrieving vector data.

- **helicone.openai_proxy.openai:** This module provides access to OpenAI API for language model interaction.

- **langchain.chains.summarize:** This module includes functionalities related to summarization tasks.

- **langchain.prompts.PromptTemplate, langchain.prompts.ChatPromptTemplate, langchain.prompts.HumanMessagePromptTemplate:** These templates are used to create prompts for language model interactions.

- **langchain.callbacks.get_openai_callback:** This callback function is used to handle OpenAI API interactions.

### Code and Data Flow:

1. Resumes are loaded from the specified folder using the **langchain.document_loaders.UnstructuredPDFLoader**.

2. Texts from the resumes are split into smaller chunks using the **langchain.text_splitter.CharacterTextSplitter** for efficient processing.

3. The job description is processed using **langchain.llms.AzureOpenAI** to obtain skill-related information from the text.

4. The skill matrix is generated by matching the skills mentioned in the job description with the candidates' resumes. The matrix includes a total score to evaluate the candidates' suitability.

5. Users can then query the tool with specific questions related to the job description, and the **langchain.chains.RetrievalQA** chain will retrieve relevant answers along with the candidate's name and a link to their resume file.

## Instructions to Run the Tool

To run the PDF Checking Tool, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that you have Python and the required libraries installed (e.g., pandas, langchain, helicone, openai).

2. Set the environment variables for necessary configurations, such as API keys and engine details.

3. Place the resumes in a local folder, Google Drive, or S3 bucket.

4. Prepare the job description text.

5. Execute the provided code to load the resumes, create the skill matrix, and enable query and resume retrieval functionality.

6. Review the generated skill matrix and query responses to identify suitable candidates for the job.

Please note that the tool may require additional configurations based on the specific setup and requirements of your system.

**Note:** Some parts of the provided code are flagged with warnings indicating that certain functionalities are no longer supported. In such cases, please refer to the updated versions or use the recommended alternatives provided in the warnings.

Remember to handle sensitive information, such as API keys and authentication details, with care and ensure proper security measures are in place while deploying the tool in a production environment.
